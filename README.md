Contains Data Science project - Titanic Survival Prediction

Here's a description of the Titanic survival prediction task:

Data Collection: The first step in this task is to gather historical data about the passengers on the Titanic. This dataset typically includes information such as passenger names, ages, genders, ticket classes, cabin numbers, the number of family members on board, fare paid, and whether or not they survived (the target variable).

Data Preprocessing: The collected data often requires extensive preprocessing to clean and prepare it for analysis. This can involve handling missing values, converting categorical variables into a numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding), and normalizing or scaling numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering is an important step where you may create new features from the existing data that might improve the model's predictive performance. For example, you could create a "family size" feature by combining the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children on board.

Data Splitting: The dataset is typically divided into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance. This helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms can be employed for this task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or more advanced techniques like gradient boosting or neural networks. The choice of model depends on the problem's complexity and dataset size.

Training the Model: The selected model is trained on the training data, where it learns the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (survival in this case).

Model Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated using the test set. Common evaluation metrics for classification problems like this include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the ROC-AUC curve.

Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this case, you'd use the model to predict whether other passengers (not in the training or test set) would have survived the Titanic disaster based on their attributes.

This task serves as a fundamental example in the field of machine learning and data science and is often used for educational purposes and as a benchmark to showcase different modeling techniques and data handling skills. It also highlights the importance of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation in building predictive models.
